# Distributed Graph Processing
First start from understanding graph which is a collection of nodes and edges ( relation between nodes).

Graph Processing refers to the process or analyzing of graphs. (graphs are used to model relationships between entities).

Because some graphs are so large that they cannot reside inside the memory of a single computer. they get distributed across multiple nodes or processes. and now graph processing on them requires parallel processing across distributed nodes.
